                <h2>Basic Information</h2>
                <p>For starters, I am 20 years old and was born in July. I was born in Colorado and raised there for the first 10 years or so of my life before moving to North Carolina and then finally to Iowa, where I have been since 2014.</p>
                <p>I graduated at high school here in Davis County in May of 2021 and went straight into college afterwards, pursuing a cybersecurity and systems administration degree. I graduate in spring.</p>
                <p>I am mostly an introverted person, and I am also very analytical and detail oriented.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>Being a Colorado native, I have always loved nature and hiking is one of the things that I enjoy the most. Alongside hiking, I also enjoy fishing and camping. Generally anything that has to do with the outdoors are things that I enjoy.</p>
                <p>As you can probably tell from my major, I have a vested interest in computers and technology and it is something that I am very skilled at. I enjoy video games in my downtime, and love Bethesda RPGs such as Skyrim and Fallout 4 (jury is still out on Starfield).</p>
                <p>Lastly, I have always had a passion for aviation and aircraft, and had I not chosen cybersecurity I probably would've majored in one of Indian Hills' aviation programs and pursued flight school afterwards to become a commercial pilot. I do flight simulation in my freetime to scratch that itch.</p>

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>Like I mentioned before, I am very skilled when it comes to computers and technology. I can handle servers, routers, switches, hardware and software troubleshooting, etc.</p>
                <p>Reading and writing are some of my better skills that I possess and have always excelled at. I am very good with grammar, typing, and structuring and read and process information at a quick pace.</p>
                <p>I get along well with people and work well in teams, but I also excel on my own. Hands on learning is my go to, and I'm at my best when allowed to tinker and experiment with devices and other items.</p>
