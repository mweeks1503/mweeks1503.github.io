            <h2>Class Information</h2>
            <p>I'm not going to list out all my classes as there is a download link to my transcript to the left, but I will give a brief rundown on them and what I've been taught.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time here at Hills, I have been taught extensively about networking, troubleshooting, software, hardware, network security, the list goes on. I have also learned a lot about coding, particularly HTML thanks to this class!</p>
            <p>Some of the major classes that I have enjoyed so far here are routing & switching essentials and network attacks. Both were right up my alley and were two of the classes that I learned the most from and contained very valuable knowledge for my field regarding operating Cisco equipment and general network attack and defense.</p>
            <p>Overall, I feel that Hills has prepared me more than enough to enter the workforce and I am excited to put my skills to use in the future.</p>
