<!--Max Weeks, 11/5/23, final project submission. it's very lackluster but I kinda had to rush through this due to circumstances outside of college that i have had to deal with. also i realized
halfway through that the design looks pretty dated but i've done too much work on it to change it so that sucks-->

        <h2>Welcome to my Website!</h2>
        <p>On this page you will find basic information about the site.</p>
        <p>This webpage and the four webpages that go along with it were created as part of my webpage development class final project. In each of the webpages you will find the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About Me: Basic information about myself. Where I'm from, how old I am, my interests, etc.</li>
            <li>Career Goals: My career goals for the future, what I plan on doing to achieve them, where I'm at now.</li>
            <li>Education: My educational history up to this point, information about some of the classes I've taken, my college GPA, etc.</li>
            <li>Samples of Classwork: Last but not least, this page includes samples of my classwork. Will have documentation that I've worked on in the past, and will also include a download link to the source code of these webpages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the bottom of each page is a footer where you can find my contact information and appropriate socials. Email, phone number, etc.</p>
        <p>Below is a brief video that describes my career field, and I also threw in a video about one of my favorite state parks-because why not.</p>
