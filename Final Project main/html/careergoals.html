    <div id="page-intro-text">
        <p>Okay, I have some pretty hefty career goals, so I'm going to divide this up into three intervals: short, medium, and long term goals.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="goals-stack"> <!--start of goals-->
        <div id="short-term">
            <h2>Short Term Goals</h2>
            <p>For some of my short term goals, I plan on just getting myself established in the workforce and working towards my certifications and maybe even a bachelor's degree. I'll list some of my goals out below:</p>
            <ul id="short-term-list">
                <li>Certifications:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CompTIA A+</li>
                        <li>CompTIA NET+</li>
                        <li>CompTIA SEC+</li>
                        <li>CompTIA CySA+</li>
                        <li>Cisco CCNA</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ontop of the certifications listed, I would like to get a stable entry level job at a good organization where I can move up consistently.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I'd like to continue my education like I mentioned at Bellevue University through tuition reimbursement at a future job if possible.</p>

        <div id="medium-term">
            <h2>Medium Term Goals</h2>
            <p>Onto medium terms goals. Nothing too crazy for these. Ideally I'd like to be in a mid level position at this point, either a systems admin, junior systems admin, or an analyst role. The expectation is that I would have a good amount of experience that would open up multiple new opportunities, which I'll get to in the next section.</p>
            <p>Outside of career, I'd also like to try and finance a house at this point (although the market ain't looking too good).</p>

        </div>
        <div id="long-term">
            <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
            <p>This is where the fun and interesting stuff comes into play. Ideally at this point I'd be pretty well established in my career, have a good chunk of certificates, and maybe a bachelor's degree.</p>
            <p>This far into my career, I'd like to get into government work. I'd like to get my government security clearance and try to join one of the "alphabet agencies": CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. There is a TON of money to be made there, and I'd be pretty much set from then on out if I can achieve it.</p>
